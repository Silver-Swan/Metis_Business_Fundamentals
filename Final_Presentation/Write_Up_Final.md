## Abstract
The purpose of this project was to determine if creating a data science model will help hospital doctors to determine if a patient will be in danger of having heart disease. The model will help doctors as well has hospitals. An early prediction will not only assist doctors but it will also help the hospital save money. With an early detection, the hospital will spend less money on the patient which will in turn save the patient from having to pay a high medical bill.

## Design
To determine if a data science model will assist doctors and the hospital, I collect a data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mokar2001/ascvd-heart-risk) and analyzed the data on both Google Sheets and Tableau. 

## Data
The data set used was from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mokar2001/ascvd-heart-risk). The data set had the features of male or female, African American or not, smoker or not, diabetic or not, hypertensive or not, age, systolic, cholesterol level, HDL level, and ASCVD Risk percentage. ASCVD or Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease. Which is a calculation of a patient's 10 year risk of having a cardiovascular problem. such as a heart attack or stroke. Other resources were used like the information on [Heart Disease Facts](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm) and [A paper on medical cost.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40273-020-00952-0#Fig2)
## Algorithms
After getting the data set from Kaggle and the other sources online, performed EDA and graphed charts using both Google Sheets and Tableau. Then perform a rough analysis on the charts to give the hospital board a recommendation on using data science to build a prediction model.
## Tools
- Google Sheets
- Tableau
