## Abstract
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. The purpose of this project was to determine if creating a data science model will be helpful to hospital doctors to determine if a patient will be in danger of having heart disease. The model will help doctors as well has the hospital. An early prediction model will assist doctors to convince the patient that they would be in danger of heart diseases and it will also help the hospital save money because they wouldn't have to admit that patient. Allowing them to spend that money on other things like equipment and other endeavors. The most important reason to build the model would be to drop the death rate cause by heart disease.

## Design
To determine if a data science model will assist doctors and the hospital, I collect a data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mokar2001/ascvd-heart-risk) and analyzed the data on both Google Sheets and Tableau. With this information, I can show that building a machine learning model to predict patient heart disease will be beneficial to doctors, patients, and the hospital.

## Data
The data set used was from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mokar2001/ascvd-heart-risk). The data set had the features of male or female, African American or not, smoker or not, diabetic or not, hypertensive or not, age, systolic, cholesterol level, HDL level, and ASCVD Risk percentage. ASCVD or Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease. Which is a calculation of a patient's 10 year risk of having a cardiovascular problem. such as a heart attack or stroke. Other resources were used like the information on [Heart Disease Facts](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm) and [A paper on medical cost.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40273-020-00952-0#Fig2)
## Algorithms
After getting the data set from Kaggle and the other sources online, performed EDA and graphed charts using both Google Sheets and Tableau. Then perform a rough analysis on the charts to give the hospital board a recommendation on using data science to build a prediction model.
## Tools
- Google Sheets
- Tableau
