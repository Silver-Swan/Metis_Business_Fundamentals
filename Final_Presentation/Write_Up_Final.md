## Abstract
The purpose of this project was to determine if creating a data science model will help hospital doctors to determine if a patient will be in danger of having heart disease. The model will help doctors as well has hospitals. An early prediction will not only assist doctors but it will also help the hospital save money. With an early detection, the hospital will spend less money on the patient which will in turn save the patient from having to pay a high medical bill.

## Design
To determine if a data science model will assist doctors and the hospital, I collect a data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mokar2001/ascvd-heart-risk) and analyzed the data on both Google Sheets and Tableau.
