# Project Title
<br>
Question:<br> Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) or commonly known as heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. CVDs are a group of diorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rtheumatic heart disease and other conditions. There are many factors increase or play a role in cardiovascular disease like high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, and high blood pressure. The problem I am approaching with this heart risk dataset aquired from Kaggle. By being able to better predict futre heart failure, would decrease deaths caused by it.

<br> Data Decription: <br>
[Heart Failure Prediction Dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) is my main source of data. The features in the data set are sex, race, smoker, diabetic, high blood pressure (hypertensive), age, maximum blood pressure (systolic), cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and ASCVD risk score. The ASCVD risk score is a national guideline developed by the American College of Cardiology. It is a calculation of the person 10-year risk of having a cardiovascular problem, such as heart attack or stroke.

Tools: 
<br>
Google sheets will be the tool that will be implimented. As well as maybe SQL and SQLite. <br>
<br>
MVP Goal:
<br>
Build a model that will help predict heart failure with the given dataset.
