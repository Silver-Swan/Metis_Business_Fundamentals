# Project Title - Making a predictive model that can help doctors diagnose patients for Cardiovascular diseases. 
<br>
Question:<br> Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) or commonly known as heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. CVDs are a group of diorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rtheumatic heart disease and other conditions. There are many factors increase or play a role in cardiovascular disease like high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, and high blood pressure. The problem I am approaching with this heart risk dataset aquired from Kaggle. By using data science to build a predictive model, a doctor can use it as a reference rather than deducing what type of CVD the patient has. About 659,000 people in the United States have passed away in a year. More information can be found on (https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm).

<br> Data Decription: <br>
[Heart Failure Prediction Dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) is my main source of data. The features in the data set are sex, race, smoker, diabetic, high blood pressure (hypertensive), age, maximum blood pressure (systolic), cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and ASCVD risk score. The ASCVD risk score is a national guideline developed by the American College of Cardiology. It is a calculation of the person 10-year risk of having a cardiovascular problem, such as heart attack or stroke.

Tools: 
<br>
Google sheets will be used to list the data gotten from the Kaggle website. As well as maybe SQL and SQLite. For visualization, Tableau will be utilized.<br>

MVP Goal:
<br>
Build a model that can be used as a first step in building a prediction model. A predictive model that a doctor can use to illustrate to a patient if they have heart disease would not only give the patients a higher rate of survival, but can also save the hospital approximately $30,000 dollars in medical cost for a heart failure patient.
